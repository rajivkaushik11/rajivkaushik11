<p>Industrial event cameras play a vital role in monitoring events in the industry and have been prevalent in use. These cameras enable manufacturers to detect quality issues and defects during the manufacturing process and also ensure that the products meet the required quality standards. The purpose of this thesis is to research on the camera-based machine monitoring system to enhance the frame rate and obtain the best possible capture quality.
Building a low-cost, low-power camera based machine monitoring system that records high-definition videos at 1080 pixels with frames per second enhanced from 5 fps to 12fps is considered. The camera based machine monitoring system consists of Raspberry Pi placed inside a robust housing equipped with LEDs to show the status of the operations and also a push button. In the case of any event detection at the industrial site, a single press of the push button on the housing saves and upload a section of the video from the Raspberry Pi to the Google drive.</p>

<p> Cooling fans are essential parts of the thermal management of electronics design, and engineers find it difficult to predict their non-linear behavior. The "fan curve", which each manufacturer publishes for every fan model, describes the fan's behavior. Those curves are manually extracted and imported for simulation since there is no component library in CST studio. The application takes user inputs in general to forecast fan curve. A Machine-learning algorithm is used to analyze fan curves from several suppliers.  With the help of the tool web-plot digitizer, extracted data points in the form of csv from the fan performance curves. Performed parsing operations to retrieve user specified data, data cleaning and data manipulation. Compared various machine learning algorithms to acquire the best fit for the application. Evaluated the model using the different metrics and observed the accuracy scores among all the machine learning models.</p>

<h3> Deep Learning Model- Image Classification</h3>
<p> Identifying healthy and diseased potato leaves using image classification.
Image classification to distinguish between healthy and sick potato leaves. A big collection of photos of leaves divided into three groups healthy, diseased, and late-stage. TensorFlow preprocessed photos, including batching and scaling. To increase loading speed, TensorFlow's cache was utilized, and the dataset was randomly shuffled. While processing the current batch of data, prefetching was used to prepare the next one. Autotune was used to dynamically modify prefetching for best results. Data augmentation methods including image flipping to broaden the diversity of the dataset. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were constructed for classification. The models appropriate for integer class labels were compiled using the Adam optimizer with sparse categorical cross-entropy loss. The model was trained over a number of epochs until it reached a stable level of accuracy and decreased loss. Training and validation accuracy and loss were computed and shown.
