<h3>Projects</h3>
<h2> AI Agent improving productivity in Engineering teams</h2>
<p>This agent helps Software, Data engineering teams understand overnight job failures faster. It monitors nightly executions, tracks which jobs passed or failed, and automatically analyzes failures. For failed jobs, the agent parses error logs, classifies the type of failure, inspects the relevant code context, and generates clear, actionable recommendations on how to fix the issue. By morning, engineers receive a clean report showing passed jobs and failed jobs with guidance, so they don’t need to manually read logs or debug blindly. The result is faster debugging, reduced operational overhead, and more reliable pipelines.</p>

<h2> Multi Agent AI App</h2>
<p>This app solves the fragmentation problem I see in today’s AI and mobile app ecosystem. Users currently rely on multiple separate apps, Each app works in isolation and lacks context from the others. My idea is to create a single AI Agent Hub where multiple task-specific agents coexist inside one app. Each agent is modular, cloud-based, and context-aware, but the user experiences them as one unified system. This reduces cognitive load, improves personalization, and avoids switching between multiple apps.</p>

<p>To fine-tune the Llama 2–7b-chat model using limited resources like Google Colab, we utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques such as QLoRA, which enables 4-bit precision training to reduce memory usage. The process involves loading the model and a preprocessed dataset from hugging face, configuring bitsandbytes for quantization, setting up QLoRA with a rank of 64 and scaling parameter of 16. The training is performed using SFTTrainer for one epoch. After training, we merge LoRA weights with the base model using the PEFT library and optionally push the fine-tuned model to the Hugging Face Hub for sharing and deployment.</p>

<p>
Integration of a language model (Google Palm) with a MySQL database to answer natural language questions about a T-shirt inventory. It connects to the database, fetches table information, and translates user queries into SQL commands. The system uses predefined examples and embeddings to improve accuracy and relevance, making it smarter in generating SQL queries. It can handle tasks like calculating inventory value, checking stock, and estimating revenue, even with discounts applied. Essentially, it enables non-technical users to interact with the database through simple language instead of writing SQL queries.

<p>Industrial event cameras play a vital role in monitoring events in the industry and have been prevalent in use. These cameras enable manufacturers to detect quality issues and defects during the manufacturing process and also ensure that the products meet the required quality standards. The purpose of this thesis is to research on the camera-based machine monitoring system to enhance the frame rate and obtain the best possible capture quality.
Building a low-cost, low-power camera based machine monitoring system that records high-definition videos at 1080 pixels with frames per second enhanced from 5 fps to 12fps is considered. The camera based machine monitoring system consists of Raspberry Pi placed inside a robust housing equipped with LEDs to show the status of the operations and also a push button. In the case of any event detection at the industrial site, a single press of the push button on the housing saves and upload a section of the video from the Raspberry Pi to the Google drive.</p>

<p> Cooling fans are essential parts of the thermal management of electronics design, and engineers find it difficult to predict their non-linear behavior. The "fan curve", which each manufacturer publishes for every fan model, describes the fan's behavior. Those curves are manually extracted and imported for simulation since there is no component library in CST studio. The application takes user inputs in general to forecast fan curve. A Machine-learning algorithm is used to analyze fan curves from several suppliers.  With the help of the tool web-plot digitizer, extracted data points in the form of csv from the fan performance curves. Performed parsing operations to retrieve user specified data, data cleaning and data manipulation. Compared various machine learning algorithms to acquire the best fit for the application. Evaluated the model using the different metrics and observed the accuracy scores among all the machine learning models.</p>

<p> Identifying healthy and diseased potato leaves using image classification.
Image classification to distinguish between healthy and sick potato leaves. A big collection of photos of leaves divided into three groups healthy, diseased, and late-stage. The images have been pre processed from the directory with the image size and batch size using the tensorflow preprocessing method. To increase loading speed, tensorFlow's cache was utilized, and the dataset was randomly shuffled. While processing the current batch of data, prefetching was used to prepare the next one. Autotune was used to dynamically modify prefetching for best results. Data augmentation methods including image flipping to broaden the diversity of the dataset. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were constructed for classification. The models appropriate for integer class labels were compiled using the Adam optimizer with sparse categorical cross-entropy loss. The model was trained over a number of epochs until it reached a stable level of accuracy and decreased loss. Training , validation accuracy, loss and confidence scores  were computed.

<p> This audio player can open, start, stop, and play audio files, and it lets users choose files and apply filters while playing. It uses PortAudio, a library that works across different operating systems for audio input and output. Filters are customizable, with settings like order and channel count, which are read using parsing algorithms.
The player connects to an IOWarrior board, which lights up LEDs in sync with the audio. Multi-threading and mutexes are used to ensure smooth performance and efficient CPU usage. Separate components were developed and then combined using a Façade design pattern. Simple sorting lets users pick which audio file to play, and they can choose filter types set in MATLAB, which have been tested to compare audio with and without filters. The design includes use cases, UML diagrams, and class and state diagrams.
